    <h2>Iron Man vs. Thanos</h2>
    <p>Using his advanced nano-tech armor, Iron Man took the fight directly to Thanos on Titan. His suit's versatility allowed for several attacks with blasters, shields, and blades. In a climactic moment, Tony Stark managed to do what no one else had: he made Thanos bleed. This critical moment proved that this was the most impactful fight against Thanos.
