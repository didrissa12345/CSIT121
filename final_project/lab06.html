            <h2>Make at least one recommendation to improve this website based on what you learned in this module.</h2>
            <p>Accessibility Checker says that a critical problem is to ensure links have discernible text. This basically means that the site uses links with undescriptive labels like "Load more" or "Read more". This could be fixed by being more descriptive, for example, "Click here for more information on Captain America."</p>
