        <h2>How is the PNG Standard Used? (With Examples)</h2>

        <p>
            The most common use of the PNG standard on the web is for company logos and site icons. For example, a company logo on a website's header needs to look sharp and clean. It should sit on top of a colored background. Using a PNG with an alpha channel allows the logo to have a transparent background so it blends perfectly into the page design. A JPEG would be stuck inside a white or solid colored box which looks unprofessional.
        </p>

        <p>
            The image below is a perfect example of this. This is a PNG file and because it supports an alpha channel the area around the graphic is fully transparent. This allows the white background of our web page to show through. If our page had a blue background, that blue would show through instead. This flexibility is the main reason PNG is used for almost all modern web design logos and user interface elements like search icons or hamburger menu buttons.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another major use for PNG is for any image where data integrity is more important than small file size. This includes screenshots, technical diagrams, charts, and infographics. When you take a screenshot of text a JPEG will add compression artifacts that make the text fuzzy and hard to read. Since PNGs are lossless they will store the screenshot pixel for pixel, keeping it perfectly clear and legible. This makes it the standard of choice for tutorials, documentation, and any visual aid where important details must be preserved.
