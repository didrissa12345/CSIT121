    <h2>Doctor Strange vs. Thanos</h2>
    <p>On the planet Titan, Doctor Strange fought Thanos in a magical duel. Strange used a number of mystical attacks, from creating countless duplicates of himself to using the Mirror Dimension. He skillfully held his own against the power of the Infinity Stones, lasting almost more than anyone and demonstrating the sheer power of the Sorcerer Supreme.
