    <h2>Captain America vs. Thanos</h2>
    <p>In one of the final battles of Avengers: Endgame, Captain America stood against Thanos and his entire army. He proved himself worthy by summoning and wielding Mjolnir. He combined the hammer's power with his vibranium shield to overwhelm Thanos with extreme lightning attacks.
